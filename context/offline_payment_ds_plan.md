## 3 Main Body Outline  
(6 sub-sections ≈ 350–400 words each)

### 3.1 Introduction & Motivation (½ page)
* **Critical Infrastructure Dependency:** Digital payments rely on cellular/internet connectivity—outages affect billions (Hurricane Sandy: $65B losses, 2019 Facebook outage: global payment disruption).
* **Developing World Challenges:** 1.7 billion adults lack banking access; rural areas with poor connectivity cannot participate in digital economy.
* **Requirements Gap:** Need for authenticity, double-spend prevention, scalability (1000+ nodes), fault tolerance, and sub-second UX without infrastructure.
* **Current Limitations:** WiFi Direct (8-device limit), NFC (proximity-only), satellite (expensive), ad-hoc networks (poor scalability).

### 3.2 Background & Related Work (¼ page)
* **Mesh Networking Evolution:** IEEE 802.11s standard, production deployments (32,767 node Bluetooth Mesh networks), self-healing capabilities.
* **Offline Payment Research:** BOLT Lightning, Pay-With-Sats, NFC card emulation—all limited by range/scalability.
* **Distributed Consensus:** BFT protocols adapted for mobile ad-hoc networks, committee-based approaches.
* **Research Gap:** No scalable, infrastructure-free payment system leveraging modern mesh capabilities.
