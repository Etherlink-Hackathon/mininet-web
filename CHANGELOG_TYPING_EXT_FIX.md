# Dependency Update Report: typing-extensions Conflict

- **Timestamp**: 2025-07-15T00:30:00Z
- **Issue**: `typing-extensions==4.8.0` conflicted with upgraded `pydantic==2.11.7` which requires `typing-extensions>=4.12.2`.

## Candidate Solutions Considered

1. **Upgrade typing-extensions to ≥4.12.2** (align with pydantic requirement).
2. Remove exact pin and allow any version (risk of nondeterministic builds).
3. Downgrade pydantic back to 2.5.x (reintroduces compile issues on Python 3.13).
4. Vendor custom wheel / internal mirror (overkill).

### Pros & Cons Summary

1. Upgrade:
   + ✅ Resolves dependency conflict immediately.
   + ✅ Retains deterministic pinning.
   + ✅ Minimal code changes, no runtime impact.
   - ❗ Must monitor future package updates.

2. Remove pin:
   + ✅ Conflict resolved automatically.
   - ❗ Non-reproducible builds across environments.

3. Downgrade pydantic:
   + ✅ Works with older typing-extensions.
   - ❌ Reintroduces original compile issues (no Py 3.13 wheels).

4. Vendor wheel:
   + ✅ Full control.
   - ❌ High maintenance overhead.

## Chosen Solution

**Upgrade typing-extensions to 4.12.2** – provides immediate, deterministic fix with zero code impact.

## Applied Changes

1. Updated `backend/requirements.txt` line from `typing-extensions==4.8.0` to `typing-extensions==4.12.2`.

## Status

success

## Next Steps / TODOs

- Reinstall backend dependencies or rebuild Docker image.
- Run backend test suite (`pytest`) to ensure runtime compatibility.
- Consider setting up Dependabot to alert on future dependency conflicts.
